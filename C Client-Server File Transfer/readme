To run the program, run the default make command to compile the client and server programs. The server can be run with ./server <port> where port is the port number the server should run on. The client can then make requests for the server to repond to with ./client <host> <port> <file> where host is the web server the server program is running on, the port is the port the server program is running on, and the file is the filename that should be returned by the server.
