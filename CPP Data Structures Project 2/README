The problems that I chose to do for this assignment are written in the problems file and all of the make commands work for any of the problems that I completed. There is also a clean command to delete the .o files created when the c++ files are compiled. The only issues I faced were with the tree implementations which were used multiple times thorughout the assignment. While both implementations work well for the most part, there are a few minor bugs when the trees get large. Other than that my assignment works well.
