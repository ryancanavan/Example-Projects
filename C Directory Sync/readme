The program can be compiled with the default make command which will produce the a.out file. This can be ran with 2 arguments where the first argument is the path to directory a and the second is the path to directory b. The program loops through the directories and if a file is found in a and not b, it is copied to b; if a file is found in both, the most recently modified version of the file overwrites the older file; and if a file is found in directory b and not a, it is deleted from directory b. Any actions the program takes are output to stdout while it is running.
