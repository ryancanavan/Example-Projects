The Makefile has all of the requested targets with the same names that were requested as well. There are four targets for tests of each of the different implementations (list array, list pointers, stack array, and stack pointers) so when the tests are run, the program will output text that shows that all of the different functions work correctly. The timing target also runs the timing experiment for the seven different tests and outputs the results. There is also a clean target that deletes the .o files that are created when the program is compiled. The only big difference between the implementations from the text book and mine is that in the array implementations, my arrays start with a value of 0 rather than 1 like in the book. I chose to do that because that is how the default arrays work in C++. Other than that, I tried to replicate the functions from the book as closely as possible. I also added a PRINTLIST() function to all four of my implementations because it was helpful for debugging even though it was not required.
