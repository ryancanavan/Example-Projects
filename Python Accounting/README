To run the program, first you have to assign $ACCT_LIST and export it. For example, use the command 'export ACCT_LIST="sample.db"' if your location of the log is in the currect directory and is called sample.db. To then run the program, simply use the command 'python accounts -i'. You can replace -i with either -h or -t if you want to show the transaction history or add a transaction to the log. You can also use the makefile to give the accounts python file execute permission with the 'make build' command. The 'make view' command will display all of the code of the accounts program, and the 'make clean' command will remove any .pyc files if they are ever created.
